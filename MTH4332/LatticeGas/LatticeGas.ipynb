Each particle in our system will be in one of four states, which we will call state 0, state 1, state 2 and state 4.  We can thus specify the microstate for a system of $N$ particles by using a NumPy array in which each element is either 0, 1, 2 or 3.  If a particle is in state 0 it has an energy of 0, if a particle is in state 1 it has an energy of 1, if it is state 2 it has an energy of 1 and if it is in state 3 it will have an energy of 2.  States 1 and 2 are thus degenerate but the total energy for our N particle system is still the sum of the energies of all the particles.\n",

The problem is that we have not developed an analytic expression by performing these programming exercises.  When we calculated the partition function we instead wrote a program that allowed us to calculate the value of the canonical partition function when the temperature and the magnetic field took on particular values.  In other words, the partition function we have learned to calculate is a single scalar and not an analytic function.  As it is not an analytic function we cannot extract values for the ensemble averages from it.\n",
